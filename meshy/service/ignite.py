"""Card-level SPMD Ignitor: GPU discovery, topology derivation, and startup.

Under card-level SPMD there is **one ignitor process per GPU card** (launched
via a single ``torchrun --nproc-per-node=<cards_per_node>``); the global
``RANK`` is the card index. Each ignitor process:

1. discovers its own card and all-gathers the global card list;
2. recomputes the deterministic full :class:`~meshy.service.topology.Topology`
   from the :class:`~meshy.service.base.ServiceGroup` DAG (endpoints included --
   no info files);
3. selects *all* Services assigned to its card, and for each (in dependency
   order) waits for its ``wait_until`` dependencies (readiness markers), then
   ``ignite()``s and ``wait_for_ready()``s it (which publishes its own marker).

Role dispatch is data-driven: the ignitor looks the role up in
:mod:`~meshy.service.registry` and calls the Service class's ``from_info``
factory. All role-specific wiring (colocate hand-off endpoints, weight-sync
targets, ...) lives inside each Service's ``from_info``, so the ignitor knows
nothing about individual roles.

Colocate (inference + trainer time-sharing the same cards) needs **no** second
torchrun: the one ignitor process on each shared card ignites the inference
replica first (which releases its GPU memory and publishes its readiness marker
on ready), then the colocate trainer, whose ``wait_until`` gate blocks on those
inference markers before it loads onto the freed cards. SGLang still runs as a
subprocess (see :mod:`meshy.service.inference`) so that its own
``torch.distributed`` init stays out of the ignitor's torchrun rendezvous -- but
that is a process-isolation concern, not an environment one, and it needs no
separate torchrun.
