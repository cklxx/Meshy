"""Critic Worker: score rollout rows, publish the value function, train it.

The critic is the actor's counterpart, not an attachment to it. It owns an
independent value network and its only coupling to the actor is the one column
it writes onto each rollout row.

Sequencing is done entirely by TransferQueue's AND-filter, exactly as OPD
sequences rollout -> Teacher -> Student. The rollout deliberately leaves that
column unwritten (``RolloutWorker(external_advantage=True)``), so a row is
invisible to the trainer until the critic fills it in::

    rollout  writes GRPO_FIELDS_NO_ADVANTAGE (reward = the shaped R)
    critic   reads  CRITIC_INPUT_FIELDS, writes "values"
    trainer  fetches GAE_TRAINER_FIELDS -> blocked until the critic wrote it,
             then runs GAE over (values, reward) itself

``publish_mode="advantage"`` keeps the older arrangement, where the critic runs
GAE and publishes one scalar per sequence into ``advantage`` and the trainer
fetches ``GRPO_TRAINER_FIELDS``. The pipeline shape is identical either way;
only the column and who runs the recursion differ.

Order within a window is load-bearing: **score with the current value function,
publish, and only then update it**. Training first would score the actor's data
with a value function already fitted to that same data, biasing the advantage
the actor consumes.

Cold start (``justrl_ii_recipe.md`` §2): for the first ``cold_start_windows``
the critic trains on rows but publishes nothing and clears them itself, so the
trainer never sees a row and the actor genuinely never steps while the
cold-start value-loss spike is absorbed. During that phase the critic also
raises the gen gate -- it is the only consumer of rollout output, so it is the
only thing that can pace the rollout (see :meth:`process_tq_batch`).
