"""Glue between Meshy's per-sample ``TensorDict`` and TQ's batched layout.

Meshy represents one rollout sample as a *batch-less* ``TensorDict`` whose
fields are variable-length tensors (``tokens`` ``[L]`` and ``logprobs`` ``[L]``),
per-sample scalars (``advantage``) or arbitrary Python objects.
TransferQueue stores and returns a *batched* ``TensorDict`` with a leading batch
dim. This module converts both ways; the column -> storage-form mapping lives in
:data:`FIELD_KINDS` so producers and consumers cannot drift apart.

Two properties of the TQ round-trip drive the design here:

**The form you put in is not necessarily the form you get back.** ``put`` unbinds
every column into per-sample values (``_select_by_positions``), and ``get_data``
re-packs them with a fallback chain: all-0-dim -> ``torch.stack``; all tensors ->
jagged nested, else strided nested, else ``NonTensorStack``
(``simple_storage_manager._pack_field_values``). :func:`td_to_samples` therefore
accepts all of those shapes rather than assuming nested.

**Slicing a packed column yields a view of the whole batch's storage.** Returning
those views verbatim makes all B samples alias one buffer, so pickling the sample
list (e.g. ``broadcast_object_list`` inside ``split_batch_to_local``) serializes
that buffer once *per sample* -- an O(B^2) blow-up, so every value
leaving this module is ``.clone()``d onto its own compact storage.
