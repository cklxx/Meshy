"""Import shim and connection helpers for the ray-free TransferQueue.

``tq_rayless`` is a companion package that runs upstream TransferQueue without
Ray: it installs a local-execution mock of ``ray`` *before* ``transfer_queue`` is
imported, so the ``@ray.remote`` controller / storage classes become plain
in-process objects with their own ZMQ servers. Ray is used upstream only for
bootstrap and endpoint discovery -- never on the data path -- so nothing is lost.

Two things must be true before ``import tq_rayless`` succeeds, and both are
handled by :func:`resolve_source`:

1. ``ray`` must NOT be installed (the shim provides it; a real Ray install would
   shadow the shim and drag in the dependency we are avoiding);
2. the upstream ``transfer_queue`` source must be locatable. ``tq_rayless``
   resolves it as ``$TRANSFER_QUEUE_SRC`` -> vendored ``third_party/TransferQueue``
   submodule -> installed package. The vendored submodule is typically not
   checked out, so we default ``TRANSFER_QUEUE_SRC`` from ``XRL_TQ_SRC``.

Meshy always runs TQ in *multi-process* mode: the controller and storage units
are standalone processes (see :mod:`meshy.transferqueue.launch`) and every worker
-- rollout and trainer -- calls :func:`connect` against the shared
endpoints ref (a ``store://`` bootstrap-store key by default, or a JSON file for
an externally managed TQ). Single-process ``start_local`` is deliberately not
exposed: it only builds in-process actors, which the other worker processes
cannot reach.
