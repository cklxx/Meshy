"""PPO + independent critic (VAPO-GAE) for MiniCPM5-2B at 128k, one 8-card node.

The GRPO recipes derive the advantage from group-normalised reward, so a group
whose samples all pass (or all fail) carries no gradient. This recipe replaces
that with a separate PPO critic: the advantage comes from a value baseline, so
zero-variance groups still carry signal (``justrl_ii_recipe.md`` §1).

Where each piece of the VAPO advantage runs
-------------------------------------------

The three stages own three disjoint parts of it, and each hands the next
exactly one column:

    rollout   r = MATH reward; R = r + overlong penalty
              -> writes `reward` = R, `raw_reward` = r
    critic    V = value net over (prompt + response), scored with the
              *pre-update* weights
              -> writes `values`; then fits V to [R, R, ..., R]
    trainer   delta[t] = R[t] + gamma*V[t+1] - V[t]
              A[t]     = delta[t] + gamma*lambda*A[t+1],
              lambda   = 1 - 1/(alpha*L)
              -> per-token A straight into the PPO ratio (`enable_gae`)

Everything above lives on one index grid: position `t` is the state that has
consumed tokens `<= t` and is about to emit token `t+1`. That is the grid
`new_lp` is defined on, so `A[t]` baselines the action whose probability the
ratio measures. The critic trains its value head on the same grid
(`critic/data.py::make_batch(shift=True)`); a value net fitted one token out
of step would be a plausible-looking baseline for the wrong action.

Scaled to one node with serial colocate: all 8 GPUs are shared among inference,
critic, and actor_train in a serial pipeline. SGLang runs in FALLBACK mode and
releases its KV-cache memory when the critic or trainer needs the node; the three
stages execute in sequence (rollout → critic → train) rather than overlapping.
This trades throughput (wall-clock per step = rollout + critic + train rather than
max of the three) for resource efficiency — useful when only one node is available.
CP4 × FSDP2 (`cp_degree=4, dp_shard_degree=2`) covers all 8 cards for both
actor and critic.

Run tempo
---------

One window = `BATCH_SIZE` = 480 rows = 60 prompts × 8 samples. The trainer's
`batch_size`, the critic's `score_batch_size` and the rollout's per-gate budget
are all that same number, so the three stages advance in lockstep.

    windows 1..30   rollout 480 rows → critic trains, publishes nothing,
                    clears the rows itself and raises the gen gate;
                    the trainer never sees a row and the actor never steps
    window 31+      rollout → critic (score with the pre-update V, publish
                    `values`, then one value step) → trainer (GAE, then 5
                    optimiser steps) → HF weight export → SGLang reload → gate

Gate stream: `0` (trainer genesis, never offset) → `1..30` (critic cold start)
→ `31..` (trainer, offset by `critic_cold_start_windows`). The rollout runs
ungated (`pacing_window=None`) and is limited only by its in-flight cap of
`2 × BATCH_SIZE` samples, so it keeps submitting into a window's long tail
instead of idling on it; the gates still carry the weight version. In-flight
requests are aborted and resumed across each colocation hand-off — see
`_rollout_group`.

Update granularity is *derived*, not declared, so it is spelled out here:
`dp("batch") = dp_replicate × dp_shard = 2` (CP does not enter the batch mesh),
so `n_local = 480/2 = 240` and `mini_batch_size=48` gives
`n_mini = 5` — **5 optimiser steps per window, each over 48×2 = 96 samples**.
Changing `dp_shard_degree` silently changes the PPO update schedule. One
update per window would make clip-higher inert (with
`old_logprobs_source="rollout"` the policy has not moved inside the update, so
only the train/inference logprob gap — the thing TIS covers — reaches the
clip); five keeps §1's clip-higher load-bearing without shrinking an update to
a single prompt group.

The critic's own tempo: `CriticSpmdEngine.micro_rows` bounds the rows resident
on the GPU per forward, *not* the update granularity — `engine/critic.py` feeds
the whole window to `train_value_accumulated`, so the critic takes
`value_epochs` steps per window. That is what makes §2's markers legible:
`warmup_steps=10` is 10 rollout steps, and "value_loss enters its normal range
after ~25 steps" is 25 windows.

Run length
----------

Nothing stops on `TrainerConfig.steps`: the trainer is TQ-driven and `steps`
only sets the LR-scheduler horizon, which `lr_decay_ratio=0.0` makes constant
anyway. The run ends when the rollout finishes `NUM_EPOCHS` over the dataset:
19,592 prompts ÷ 60 = 326 windows, minus 30 cold-start windows = **296 actor
steps**. §5 puts the useful window at ~170 steps with the peak at iter169, so
one epoch covers the peak with room to watch the decay past it. (The 32-prompt
tail of the epoch never fills a 480-row window and simply stays in the queue.)

Note that a second epoch would be a *verbatim* replay: `worker/rollout.py`
rebuilds the dataset per epoch from the same `seed`, so the shuffle is
identical.

Disk
----

`enable_checkpoint=True` does **not** produce periodic training checkpoints
here: `TitanTrainer.save_checkpoint` (DCP) has no caller in the RL loop and
`hf_save_interval` is plumbed but unused. What actually lands on disk is the
colocation weight-sync export — a full 2.25B HF checkpoint written to
`checkpoints/actor_train/v{N}/` **every step**, with no rotation anywhere in
the tree. Over 296 steps that is terabytes; §5 notes production jobs dying of
"临时存储超限". Size the scratch volume or prune `v{N}` out of band before
starting a long run.

Not implemented
---------------

§1/§3 items this recipe cannot express, beyond the table above:

- **in-loop eval** is the one that matters most. §5's first boundary is that
  training reward keeps climbing past the peak and the ~3pp/100-step
  degradation is invisible to every training-side metric, so the peak ckpt can
  only be selected by in-loop eval. There is no eval role in `meshy/service/`,
  so this run produces no basis for choosing a checkpoint.
- **positive_lm_loss**, **critic checkpointing** (a crash loses the value net)
  and the three §2 gauges as dashboard metrics (they are loguru-only) are all
  absent.
- **dynamic sampling** is implemented but off here; see
  `filter_zero_std_groups` in `_rollout_group` for why that is a choice rather
  than a gap.

    # cap*, not the fraction, was what actually sized the pool. SGLang clamps
    # `min(profiled, max_total_tokens)` (`kv_cache_configurator.py::
